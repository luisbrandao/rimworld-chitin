Simple mod that adds boots and gloves to Rimworld.

Tired of having your colonists wearing expensive hyperwave cloths, and walking around barefoot? Squirrels keep biting off you fingers? Protect yourself!

#Features

==== Footwear:
Sandals:
   Sandals will give you almost no protection from damage or cold, but they will make you fast and help in hot biomes.

Boots:
   Boots give you the most protection, but are hot and heavier

Shoes:
   Shoes are more expensive, worth more, and are more balanced.

==== Hand-wear:
Work gloves: Protect your hands, so you can work faster!

Mining gloves: tick gloves. Good for mining, bad for working. They also offers more protection.

Medic gloves: Thin gloves with limited lifespan. They do assist in medical operations.

==== Rings:
Rings are expensive and hard to make, but they give social impact and worth a lot.

# Know bugs
Bionics: The issue is with the core of Rimworld.... bionic arms and legs have no hands, fingers, foots and toes. Any fix i try would make this mod a lot more complex, and would break many other mods like EPOE.

Japanese Translation: (Someone was nice enough to make one)
